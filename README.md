# Work Item Throughput  
![ScreenShot](https://travis-ci.org/RallyTechServices/workitem-throughput.svg?branch=master)

## Summary/Description

![screenshot](./images/screenshot.png "This is an example")

This app shows work item (User Stories and Defects) throughput either as a *count* or a *sum* of the configured field in the app settings.  The available fields for summing are: 
* Plan Estimate
* Task Estimate Total
* Task Actual Total 

This app uses the Accepted Date to determine what date bucket to include the work item into.  This app does NOT use the Lookback API.    

Only work items that do not have children will be included in the throughput sum or counts.  Stories that are parents to other stories will not be included.    

The current increment will not be included in the chart.  For example, if the timebox granularity = "Monthly" and #Timeboxes = 3 and the current date is April 15, the through put will be shown 
for the following month buckets:  
Jan-17  
Feb-17  
Mar-17  
Throughput data will not be shown for the current (incomplete) month.    


## App Settings 

#### Throughput Measure
How to measure throughput.  The options are:  Count, Plan Estimate, Task Actual Total and Task Estimate Total.    
If Count is selected, the throughput will be the count of work items (without children)  
If Plan Estimate, Task Actual Total or Task Estimate Total are selected, then the throughput will be the sum of the field for all work items without children.    

#### Allow settings change by users 
If this is checked, then the non-admin users can change the Granularity and the # timeboxes on the front of the app.
If this is not checked, then the granularity and # timeboxes selectors will not be shown on the front of the app and the settings can only be changed via the App Settings.  

#### Timebox Granularity
This determines whether throughput will be bucketed into Weeks, Months or Quarters 

#### #Timeboxes
This determines how many timeboxes in the past throughput will be calculated for.  This does not include the current bucket.  



## Development Notes


### First Load

If you've just downloaded this from github and you want to do development, 
you're going to need to have these installed:

 * node.js
 * grunt-cli
 * grunt-init
 
Since you're getting this from github, we assume you have the command line
version of git also installed.  If not, go get git.

If you have those three installed, just type this in the root directory here
to get set up to develop:

  npm install

### Structure

  * src/javascript:  All the JS files saved here will be compiled into the 
  target html file
  * src/style: All of the stylesheets saved here will be compiled into the 
  target html file
  * test/fast: Fast jasmine tests go here.  There should also be a helper 
  file that is loaded first for creating mocks and doing other shortcuts
  (fastHelper.js) **Tests should be in a file named <something>-spec.js**
  * test/slow: Slow jasmine tests go here.  There should also be a helper
  file that is loaded first for creating mocks and doing other shortcuts 
  (slowHelper.js) **Tests should be in a file named <something>-spec.js**
  * templates: This is where templates that are used to create the production
  and debug html files live.  The advantage of using these templates is that
  you can configure the behavior of the html around the JS.
  * config.json: This file contains the configuration settings necessary to
  create the debug and production html files.  
  * package.json: This file lists the dependencies for grunt
  * auth.json: This file should NOT be checked in.  Create this to create a
  debug version of the app, to run the slow test specs and/or to use grunt to
  install the app in your test environment.  It should look like:
    {
        "username":"you@company.com",
        "password":"secret",
        "server": "https://rally1.rallydev.com"
    }
  
### Usage of the grunt file
####Tasks
    
##### grunt debug

Use grunt debug to create the debug html file.  You only need to run this when you have added new files to
the src directories.

##### grunt build

Use grunt build to create the production html file.  We still have to copy the html file to a panel to test.

##### grunt test-fast

Use grunt test-fast to run the Jasmine tests in the fast directory.  Typically, the tests in the fast 
directory are more pure unit tests and do not need to connect to Rally.

##### grunt test-slow

Use grunt test-slow to run the Jasmine tests in the slow directory.  Typically, the tests in the slow
directory are more like integration tests in that they require connecting to Rally and interacting with
data.

##### grunt deploy

Use grunt deploy to build the deploy file and then install it into a new page/app in Rally.  It will create the page on the Home tab and then add a custom html app to the page.  The page will be named using the "name" key in the config.json file (with an asterisk prepended).

To use this task, you must create an auth.json file that contains the following keys:
{
    "username": "fred@fred.com",
    "password": "fredfredfred",
    "server": "https://us1.rallydev.com"
}

(Use your username and password, of course.)  NOTE: not sure why yet, but this task does not work against the demo environments.  Also, .gitignore is configured so that this file does not get committed.  Do not commit this file with a password in it!

When the first install is complete, the script will add the ObjectIDs of the page and panel to the auth.json file, so that it looks like this:

{
    "username": "fred@fred.com",
    "password": "fredfredfred",
    "server": "https://us1.rallydev.com",
    "pageOid": "52339218186",
    "panelOid": 52339218188
}

On subsequent installs, the script will write to this same page/app. Remove the
pageOid and panelOid lines to install in a new place.  CAUTION:  Currently, error checking is not enabled, so it will fail silently.

##### grunt watch

Run this to watch files (js and css).  When a file is saved, the task will automatically build, run fast tests, and deploy as shown in the deploy section above.
